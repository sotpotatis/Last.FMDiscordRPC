# Last.FM Discord RPC

Script that runs in the background and check a Last.FM
account for any recent scrobbles. If found, the recent scrobbles (plays)
are shown as a now playing status in Discord.

Similar to my [VÃ³lumio RPC](https://github.com/sotpotatis/VolumioRPC)

### Installation

1. Get a [Last.FM API key](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)
2. Get a [Discord client ID](https://discord.com/developers/applications) - detailed instructions can be found [here]()
3. Create a file in the code directory named `config.toml`,
copying the configuration layout from the file `example_config.toml`
4. Run the script and enjoy!
